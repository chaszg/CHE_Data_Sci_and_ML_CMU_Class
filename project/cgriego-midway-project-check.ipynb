I'm wondering if I should eliminate spaces and try to match the compositions of characters between an entry in my DataFrame and an entry in the university DataFrame. It might be significantly easier to just eliminate entries with a university name that only occurs once. I'm a little hesitant about eliminating data points, but it could be possible that those points don't add any significance to my analysis.

It is more interesting for the model to predict if someone wins the award or doesn't, and unfortunately, NSF does not provide data of applicants that weren't recognized.

If I have more time, I would still like to make a more sophisticated figure, like a heat map of the United States that shows states with a higher number of recipients, and if the user clicks on a state, a new figure is displayed that shows a bar graph of number of recipients versus institution.
